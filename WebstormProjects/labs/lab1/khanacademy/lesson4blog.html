<h4 class="declaration">July 30, 2019: Start your journey in IT: 9 tips from the experienced</h4>
<p class="color">Tip 1: Ask!</p>
<p>Perhaps the first and very obvious advice is don't be afraid to ask. Asking questions is an important skill, one of the most useful in the future, in my opinion. By the way, you can ask not only your direct comrades in the project / type of activity, but also colleagues from related fields: testers, managers, analysts. Sometimes accidentally acquired knowledge turns out to be the key to understanding more serious problems. In addition, human experience is the most valuable thing, many things cannot be learned from books. Over time, an understanding of this comes.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 2: Write it down!</p><p>
    Did you have an idea about what can be done in the project? Save it. Did you come up with an idea how you can improve your skills? Write it down. Then you can review these notes and learn something important, or maybe realize that you have already achieved something. In times of crisis, such "saves" help you remember why you chose what you do in the first place.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 3: Get inspired!</p><p>
    Another thing is to find non-financial motivation. When a person decides to "enter IT" for the sake of relatively high salaries, without being interested in the field as such, it is very noticeable. There is nothing wrong with the financial component, but it should not be the only driving factor. If the eyes are not burning, then no zeros in the workbook will be able to light them.

    It's useful to turn everything into a game, no wonder gamification is one of the best learning techniques. Let skills become achievements, project difficulties become levels, and difficulties on the way become dragons that must be defeated. Banal human excitement works here, and with this approach, even seemingly boring things become much more fun and exciting.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 5: Tell me!</p><p>

    In addition, it is good practice to tell others about what you are doing and teaching. It's not so important to anyone: it may be a younger brother or sister, parents who are interested in what you do there, non—IT friends, or maybe another intern or a newcomer. We must try to convey the information as accurately as possible, but simply so that a person without experience can roughly understand what it is about. There is such a saying: those who think clearly, state clearly. But it also works the other way: having learned to articulate clearly, a person structures and puts knowledge in his head, and this helps him to better understand the subject himself.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 6: Read it!</p><p>
    Start your way in IT: 13 tips from seasoned 4
    It was thanks to literature that I developed my first skills. At first it will be difficult even with basic things, but do not give up. When such moments happened, I would take notes on incomprehensible chapters in a notebook and repeat them to myself from memory. It is necessary to give the brain time to process an array of new and complex information for it. After some time, everything will fit in and assimilate itself, the main thing is not to despair.

    A separate sub—item is the documentation in the original: the original mode is preferable - and the loss of information is less, and the pumping of the language is stronger.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 7: Take a good rest!</p><p>
    Most often, when you come home after work, you want to relax — lie on the couch, play YouTube, read something before going to bed… Relax wisely! Reclining on the couch, sort out issues on GitHub; prefer a useful performance by a colleague to a new episode of the series; instead of counting sheep, click algorithmic puzzles in your mind — all this imperceptibly trains the brain, increases the knowledge base, and you don't even notice how you are pumping!
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 8: Go for it!</p><p>

    Most likely, it will take time and more than one attempt to get the first offer. I got to my first job after 7 unsuccessful attempts, but there may be many more, it means absolutely nothing. The main thing is to always keep in mind that one day there will certainly be exactly the same interview.
</p>
<p  class="color">Tip 9: Listen wisely!</p><p>
    I would advise you to filter the information and have your own opinion, while remaining flexible. The ability to work with information means a lot at first: there is a lot of information, sources are different, points of view are contradictory… And until I have fully mastered the fundamental things, it seems that everything is essential; until I have tried a myriad of technologies and written bicycles myself, the level of other developers seems unrealistically steep. Is it okay, is it going away? It is important to be critical of information, to consider the problem from different points of view, and as a guideline, you can choose the position of more experienced comrades who have already proven their authority in practice. It's not a technical skill at all, but it's surprisingly important in development.

<h2 id="book">Books</h2>
<h4 class="declaration">July 30, 2019: Start your journey in IT: 9 tips from the experienced</h4>
<p class="color">Decide on the pace.</p>
<p>For study or research purposes, you may need to study an extensive list of literature in a short period of time. You don't have to read them from cover to cover: just understand what they are about, study all the annotations, contents and notes, isolate the thoughts that attracted attention. This will affect the pace and depth of learning of the book, but will allow you to achieve the goal.

    If you read for pleasure, you won't have deadlines or strict rules for reading. If the book needs to be completed by a certain date, it is better to divide it into equal parts and read at least the required volume daily.

    This is exactly what I do with books in English: I set a daily rate, which becomes a habit and after a short time I manage to read more than the minimum with pleasure.
</p>
<p  class="color">Get to know the book.</p><p>
    Do not be lazy to study the information about the author, the preface, reviews, annotations and contents. This will allow you to adjust expectations and prepare for the perception of the information under the cover.

    If you are reading for study / work, then familiarization with the table of contents will allow you to immediately go to those chapters where there are answers to your questions.
</p>
<p  class="color"> Prepare the tools</p><p>
    If you read non-fiction in paper, you will need not only a book, but also some inventory:

    A simple pencil for marginal notes or notes.
    Highlighter marker for highlighting important thoughts.
    Stickers and/or bookmarks.
    The paper is wonderful because it will preserve all your impressions of the book. Highlight ideas and thoughts with a pencil or marker, make notes in the margins.
</p>
<p  class="color">Take notes</p><p>
    Writing down extensive thoughts in the process of reading helps me either with a separate notebook or a sheet with stickers. It has not only bookmarks, but also leaves for notes, and this is much more convenient than trying to put everything in the margins. Write out and mark everything that seems important or useful to you, do not be lazy to write down your thoughts or ideas: if you think that you will remember it later, then no, you will not remember.
