<h3>
  Basic info
</h3>
<p>Hawaii (island) is a volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean, one of the eight main Hawaiian islands forming the U.S. state of Hawaii.</p>
<h3>
  Only in Hawaii
</h3>
<p>For a taste of classic Hawaii, take a private hula dance lesson and learn to make leis with the Hawaii Hula Company. In the spring, the Merrie Monarch Festival gathers the best hula groups for a visually spectacular competition and other traditional cultural activities. You’ll find slack-key guitarists, known as ki hoalu, performing at the Outrigger resorts in Waikiki; there’s also a Slack Key Festival in Kona every September. The Bishop Museum in Honolulu houses the world’s largest collection of Polynesian artifacts, and the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu’s northeast coast offers visitors an authentic luau dinner and show. The island of Molokai is home to the Kalaupapa National Historical Park, which preserves the leprosy colonies that operated there until 1969, near the tallest sea cliffs in the world.</p>
