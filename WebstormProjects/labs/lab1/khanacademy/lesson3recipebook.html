<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare the necessary ingredients.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 2:</strong> How to make pizza dough:
    Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water, add 2-3 tablespoons of flour. Mix everything together and leave for 15 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 3:</strong>Add salt and vegetable oil to the resulting dough and, gradually adding flour, knead a soft elastic dough.
    Knead the dough for 5 minutes on a floured surface. If the dough sticks strongly to your hands, grease them with oil, but do not add too much flour so as not to clog the dough.
    Form a bun from the dough, put it in a greased container and leave the dough to "rest" for 40-60 minutes. The dough should come up and increase in volume.
    From the specified number of ingredients, about 600 g of pizza dough is obtained.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 4:</strong> I've been cooking pizza with only homemade sauce for a long time. This is a completely different level, I highly recommend trying it.
    For the "lazy" sauce, chop the tomatoes very finely. For this purpose, you can use a meat grinder or a blender. If you are not lazy, then you can remove the peel from the tomatoes, having previously blanched them: put them in boiling water for 5 minutes, then in ice water - the peel will be well removed.
    (Fresh tomatoes can be replaced with tomato paste.)
</p>
<p><strong >Step 5:</strong> Chop the basil. If there is no fresh one, you can use 1 teaspoon of dry basil.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 6:</strong>Chop the garlic.
    Fry the tomatoes in vegetable oil. Evaporate the excess liquid from them, add finely chopped garlic and basil, salt and sugar to taste.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 7:</strong>Prepare the ingredients for the filling, grind them in a convenient way for you.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 8:</strong>Roll out the dough into a circle 0.5 cm thick, carefully, in order to preserve the formed air bubbles as much as possible.
    Lubricate the pizza preparation with sauce.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 9:</strong>Spread the filling on top (take the same amount of filling as the dough).
    Preheat the oven to 250 degrees, bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, no more, no need to over-dry the dough and
</p>
<p><strong >Step 10:</strong>The crusts of the finished hot pizza can be greased with olive oil, or you can skip this step by covering the pizza with a towel for literally 2 minutes so that the crusts soften.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>To cook corn dogs, prepare the products. For the recipe, take your favorite delicious sausages. If you did not find corn flour at home, you can replace it with wheat flour and make a batter only from wheat flour, it will also be very tasty.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 2:</strong> Mix the dry ingredients in a container with high walls so that it is easy to dip the sausages in the future.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 3:</strong>Add the egg, mix, pour in the milk until a very thick dough is obtained.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 4:</strong> Sausages are pre-rolled in flour.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 5:</strong>We pierce each sausage with a skewer and dip it completely into the dough so that the upper part of the skewer is also covered with dough.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 6:</strong>Preheat the fryer to 150-170 degrees, fry the sausages in the dough, rotating the skewers so that the corn dogs are evenly browned.
</p>
<p><strong >Step 7:</strong>We serve it with our favorite sauces and enjoy!
